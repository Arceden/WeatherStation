Weather Station project ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20Release-v1.0-brightgreen.svg)
==============
This project is a group project for the Hanze University of Applied Siences. Here, we will build a system which can process, store and deliver weather data from weather stations in Botswana.
The project will make use of a Raspberry Pi 3b as the server which receives the weather data from the stations and a virtual machine with Ubuntu which serves as a remote database and as a webserver.

The README will be updated further during the development of the project.
